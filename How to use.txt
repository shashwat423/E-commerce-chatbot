In Terminal do the following:

1) go to your project directory "cd .\E-com_chatbot\"

2) run this command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass"

3) run = .\E-com_chatbot\venv_py310\Scripts\activate

4) rasa train

5) rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug --endpoints endpoints.yml (in one terminal)

6) simultaneously run = "rasa run actions" <in another terminal> (do first 3 steps before running this)


Note: when number 5 stops at coroutine debugging open rasa ui from the "ui" folder, there you can chat with the bot.
      Also close all the csv files related to this project before running above commands.
